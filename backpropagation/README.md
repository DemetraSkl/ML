# Backpropagation

The backpropagation net uses gradient descent to minimize the error rate. The algorithm follows the error surface and updates weights in the direction of descent. 

## Installing

To build the source code I used ant. All tasks are defined in the
build.xml file. The main code routine is in Main.java

To get the results for all experiments simply run ant.
